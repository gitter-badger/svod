# Свод

*Work in progress. If you have questions about the project, please send me
 an email to markkarpov at opmbx dot org.*

This is going to be an open source web application of Свод (Svod) netlabel
written in Haskell using Yesod web framework. Due to many factors, it's
still difficult to estimate when it will be operational.
